# BAN440 - Term Paper

Group members: William Eide, Øyvind Odland, Sander Eriksen

This Project accounted for 70% of the grade in the course BAN440 - Data Driven Business Analysis. As an efficient way of collaborating on code development, this repository was used to collect and manage our work. 

The project has turned out to be one of my favorite projects at NHH, both for its freedom of choice and the topics covered that we used in our work. Contrary to other courses, we actually got the opportunity to do some real-life research in terms of finding our own data and shape a problem question. As well, we got good help from our professors Morten Sæthre and Mateusz Mysliwski who were keen to help and genuinely interested in what we worked on. 

After this semester, I am confident in saying I know more about Norway's many municipalities and Vinmonopolet stores than the average man in the street, as much time was spent analyzing data from Vinmonopolet and Statistics Norway (SSB). We are really happy with how the report turned out, and we actually got some interesting results with farely simple methodological approaches. 

Give the main report a read if you like and immerse yourself into Norway's monopolized alcohol retail market!
